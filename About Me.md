## 🏆 Notable Projects

- **Predictive Maintenance:** Developed a deep neural network to predict flight simulator motion system failures, achieving over 66% recall. Utilized PySpark for handling massive telemetry data, leading to an expected recovery of over \$2M CAD in lost training revenue annually.

- **Demand Forecasting:** Created a model that reduced demand prediction error (MAE) by nearly 50% compared to the baseline, enhancing operational efficiency within a resource allocation management system.

- **AI Snag Resolution:** Fine-tuned a GPT model to assist technicians in resolving flight simulator failures more efficiently, reducing time to resolution and allowing same-day troubleshooting for over 37% of failures.

- **Speech-to-Text Model:** Fine-tuned the OpenAI Whisper model to detect specific pilot callouts during flight phases, achieving over 97% detection rate, significantly outperforming the original model.

- **Customer Churn Prediction:** Developed the first company-wide customer churn prediction model using XGBoost, achieving a recall of over 72%, providing actionable insights for business units.
